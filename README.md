# Eatsy food delivery application

![alt text](https://github.com/shihabkandil/eatsy/blob/development/image.jpg?raw=true)

A Food delivery application developed using Flutter framework and Firebase.
Using Feature-Driven Architecture. To manage the app's state, the Bloc state management pattern is used, with separate BLoCs for each feature. The app uses the auto_route package for declarative routing, allowing for easy navigation between screens.
To ensure the app is working as intended, automation testing is included with unit testing, widget testing, and integration testing. Unit tests are used to test individual functions and classes, while widget tests are used to test individual widgets and their interactions. Integration tests are used to test the app as a whole, including interactions between different features.
This architecture and testing approach allow for a scalable, maintainable, and reliable app development process, with clear separation and testing to catch any potential issues.
